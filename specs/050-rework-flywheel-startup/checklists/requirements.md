# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix CMG Flywheel Startup Stall Using a Validated Brushless-Motor Sequence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass on the first validation pass. No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were needed: the two highest-impact open questions (the corrected sequence's final operating-speed target, and whether the prior fault-detection/retry heuristic is kept, retuned, or replaced) have reasonable defaults documented in the spec's Assumptions section and are deferred to the planning phase as bench-tuning details rather than scope-defining decisions.
- Ready for `/speckit.plan`.
